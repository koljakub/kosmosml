# KosmosML
### An easy-to-use library for Content-based image retrieval and Image captioning
Part of **Kosmos**: https://github.com/tomasprorok/kosmos-backend, a two 
semester project realized within courses Team Project I and II at the University of Ostrava.

## Features
### Custom PyTorch modules
* Pooling and normalization layers
* Backbone models for both Content-based image retrieval and Image captioning

### Content-based image retrieval models
Various state of the art models are provided:
* Neural Codes for Image Retrieval (https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.1777)

### Memory-efficient dimensionality reduction
* Scikit-learn IncrementalPCA wrapper with a low memory footprint

### Memory-efficient indexers
* hnswlib HNSW indexer wrapper with a low memory footprint
